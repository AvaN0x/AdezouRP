# Ragdoll ü•¥

* To enable ragdoll, change `RagdollEnabled = false,` to true in config.lua.

* To change which key is responsible for ragdoll, `RagdollKeybind = 303` is currently set to `U` by default., -- Get the button number [here](https://docs.fivem.net/game-references/controls/)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Menu Keybind üéõÔ∏è

**Important Note:**

The keybind uses RegisterKeyMapping. By default, the server owner configured keybind in the *initial* config.lua will be the default key, however once the keybind is set for a user, it'll stay with this new value. Editing the config keybind will change it for new players only.

* Menu key:* F5

F3 and F4 clash with [Menyoo](https://github.com/MAFINS/MenyooSP) and controllers üéÆ

Server owners can change this in the `config.lua`;

```lua
MenuKeybind = 'F5', -- Get the button string here https://docs.fivem.net/docs/game-references/input-mapper-parameter-ids/keyboard/
```

Alternatively, the player base can set their own menu keybind to open DpEmotes

```lua
Esc > settings > keybinds > fivem > dpemotes
```

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# Keybinds and SQL üéõÔ∏è

The original dpemotes uses mysql-async which was then changed to ghmattimysql. Unfortunately, they are no longer maintained. 

To use the SQL features, install the [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql) resource. If you do not want to use the SQL features, comment out the `oxmysql` region in fxmanifest.lua.

# Installation Instructions ‚öôÔ∏è:

* add DpEmotes to your `server.cfg`

* [Enforce gamebuild to latest build](https://forum.cfx.re/t/tutorial-forcing-gamebuild-to-casino-cayo-perico-or-tuners-update/4784977) for all emotes and props to work correctly

* start dpemotes

# Shared emotes üë©üèª‚Äç‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüíã‚Äçüë®üèº

Emotes will work with either `SyncOffset` or `Attachto`.

- If it is with `SyncOffsetFront` or `SyncOffsetSide`, then the offset used is the one of the emote the player started.<br/>
For example, if player one starts the emote `handshake` which has `SyncOffsetFront`, then player one will have the `SyncOffsetFront` but not the other player.


- If it is with `Attachto`, then it'll either be player one's data used for attaching, or the player two's data.<br/>
For example, if player one start the emote carry, then the other player will be attached but not the player one because Attachto is set in `carry2` and not `carry`.<br/>
- If player one starts the emote `carry2`, then player one will be attached and not the other player.
it's the player who start the animation who will in most cases be moved


*Special case, if both emote have the `Attachto` then only the player who started the emote will be attached.*

You can find a list of ped bones to attach the other player here: [Ped Bones](https://wiki.rage.mp/index.php?title=Bones)

Using the website provided above, enter the bone ID, ie `1356` and not 111, which is the Bone Index.

# FAQs üó®Ô∏è

**Q: Why do some emotes not work with females?**

**A:** Blame Rockstar Games. I've done my best to replicate animations to work with females, however some male scenarios have sound effects and particles, of which I am unfamiliar with and syncing particles is out of my expertise.

----------------------

**Q: Why do some emotes not work at all?**

**A:** Check the Installation Instructions above as you need to be on the highest FiveM gamebuild.

----------------------

**Q: Why do I see particle effects but other players don't?**

**A:** Dullpear and I can't figure out how to sync particles. If you know how, feel free to inform me.

----------------------

**Q: I bought this script off someone and notice it had a lot of the same animations. Can you help me?**

**A:** You got scammed and that's your fault. Dpemotes is and always will be **FREE**.

----------------------

**Q: Can I add my own emotes to this?**

**A:** Of course, see my in depth [tutorial](https://forum.cfx.re/t/how-to-menyoo-to-dpemotes-conversion/4775018) for using Menyoo and converting them to work with dpemotes.

You may sell ***custom made*** animations, however the menu must remain free.

----------------------

**Q: I bought a pack of custom animations, how can I add them to your fork of dpemotes?**

**A:** Usually the person who created them will provide code snippets for adding animations to dpemotes. If for whatever reason they haven't, you should contact them.

We have however added code to hopefully make it a lot easier to add shared emotes.

----------------------

**Q: How do I reset the SQL keybinds?**

**A:** No idea, but apparently only the server owner can ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Google exist; Maybe contact the creator.

----------------------

**Q: How do Shared Emotes work?**

**A:** Please see the Shared Emotes section of this ReadMe for more information.
