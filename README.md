AdezouRP *~~is~~* was a FiveM RolePlay server.

Made and remade a lot of scripts, some are based on others because I didn't have the knowledge of FiveM required.

Big thanks to the FiveM and ESX community for all those open source resources.

## AVA Framework

The framework was inspired by the [ESX framework](https://github.com/esx-framework/esx_core).
I hope that I got the licenses right, if not **please let me know**. I'll be please to fix it.

## License

I don't take any credits over the resources that were not made by me.

I hope that I got the licenses right but if there is any problem with any of them or one is missing in a resource **please let me know**. I'll be please to fix it.
