AdezouRP is a FiveM RolePlay server.

Made and remade a lot of scripts, some are based on others because I don't have the knowledge of FiveM required.

Big thanks to the FiveM and ESX community for all those open source resources.

## PLEASE

If there's any problem with one of the resource's licenses please let me know with a pull request, I'll be please to fix them.
